%"Treatment of systematic uncertainties in precision top-quark measurements (including correlations in differential cross-sections among different distributions)”

%CMS abstract
%Using the large data sample of Run-II LHC, the treatment of systematic uncertainties plays a crucial role in the precision era of the top quark measurements. Uncertainties can be determined in situ, profiled in the fit, externalised and/or determined from pseudo-experiments. A selected set of precise top quark measurements (cross section?, direct top mass?, top width?) from ATLAS and CMS is presented where justifications are provided and discussed for every treatment.

A review of some of the recent \emph{top}-quark precision measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations is presented. The different approaches for the determination of the systematic uncertainties are discussed.

\section{Introduction}
The \emph{top}-quark was observed for the first time in proton-antiproton ($p\bar{p}$) collisions at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 Collaborations %
\cite{Abe_1995,Abachi_1995}. Since its first observation, this particle has been studied in great detail, both at the Tevatron and the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The \emph{top}-quark is the heaviest elementary particle of the Standard Model (SM): the average mass, computed by combining the measurements performed by the Tevatron and the LHC experiments \cite{atlas2014combination}, is $173.34\pm0.27(\text{stat})\pm0.71(\text{syst})$.
Due to its large mass the \emph{top}-quark lifetime is smaller than the hadronisation time. For this reason, contrary to what happens to the lighter quarks, the \emph{top}-quark is never confined in bound states (\emph{hadrons}). This peculiarity offers the unique opportunity to study the properties of a "free" quark.
Moreover, the \emph{top}-quark has the largest Yukawa coupling with the Higgs boson. Because all of this, the \emph{top}-quark properties are extensively measured to test the SM and to search for hints of physics beyond the SM.\\ 
At the LHC, \emph{top}-quarks are mainly produced in pairs of top-antitop ($t\bar{t}$) with a cross-section of around 800$pb$ at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV.
%\begin{equation}
%\sigma_{t\bar{t}}(13~\text{TeV}, m_{\text{top}}=172.5~\text{GeV}, \text{NLO}) = 831.76^{+19.77}_{-29.20}(\text{stat})^{+35.06}_{-35.06}(\text{PDF+\alpha_s})^{+23.18}_{-22.45}(\text{mass}) pb
%\end{equation}
The large amount of \emph{top}-quarks produced at the LHC opened to a new era of precision measurements, where the systematic uncertainties dominate the final results. Systematic uncertainties arise in all physics analyses where there exist uncertainties in the predictions of any of the Monte Carlo simulation steps. Uncertainties arising from the detector simulation are normally referred to as \emph{experimental}, whereas any uncertainty that arises in any of the other steps is usually classified as \emph{theoretical}. In most of the \emph{top}-quark related measurements, the main contribution to the systematic uncertainty is given by the theoretical uncertainties.\\
For this reason, in the past years there was a big effort in both the theoretical and experimental communities to improve the predictions provided by the Monte Carlo simulations. Higher older calculations have been realised and the data have been used to tune the models.
Moreover, different techniques for the estimation of theoretical uncertainties have been developed. In this work, a set of precise \emph{top}-quark measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments is presented, where the different approached for the systematic uncertainties estimation are compared and discussed.
