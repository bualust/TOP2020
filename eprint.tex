%"Treatment of systematic uncertainties in precision top-quark measurements (including correlations in differential cross-sections among different distributions)‚Äù

%CMS abstract
%Using the large data sample of Run-II LHC, the treatment of systematic uncertainties plays a crucial role in the precision era of the top quark measurements. Uncertainties can be determined in situ, profiled in the fit, externalised and/or determined from pseudo-experiments. A selected set of precise top quark measurements (cross section?, direct top mass?, top width?) from ATLAS and CMS is presented where justifications are provided and discussed for every treatment.

A review of some of the recent top-quark precision measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations is presented. The different approaches for the determination of the systematic uncertainties are discussed.

\section{Introduction}
The top-quark was observed for the first time in proton-antiproton ($p\bar{p}$) collisions at the Tevatron by the D0 and CDF Collaborations %
\cite{Abazov_2009,Aaltonen_2009}. 
The mass of the top-quark is 
The top-quark mass is the heaviest elementary particle in the Standard Model: due to its mass
The top-quark, which was first observed in proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron, is the heaviest elementary particle 
The large data sample delivered by the Large Hadron Collider during its Run 2 opened to a new era of top-quark precision measurements. The treatment of the systematic uncertainties plays a crucial role in the determination of the cross-section and fundamental properties of the top-quark. A set of precise top-quark measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments is presented, where the different techinques for the systematic uncertainties estimation are discussed.
