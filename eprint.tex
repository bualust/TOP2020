\section{Introduction}
The \emph{top}-quark was observed for the first time in proton-antiproton ($p\bar{p}$) collisions at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 Collaborations 
\cite{Abe_1995,Abachi_1995}. It is the heaviest Standard Model (SM) particle known: its average mass, computed by combining the measurements performed by the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments \cite{atlas2014combination}, is 
\begin{equation}
m_{\mathrm{top}} = 173.34 \pm 0.27(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.71(\mathrm{syst})~\mathrm{GeV}.
\end{equation}
Due to its mass the \emph{top}-quark has the largest Yukawa coupling and its lifetime is smaller than the hadronisation time. From this latter fact, it derives that the \emph{top}-quark is never confined in bound states (\emph{hadrons}), offering the unique opportunity to study the properties of a ``free" quark.
For these reasons, the \emph{top}-quark is considered to be a good probe to test the SM and beyond and, since the first observation, its properties have been studied in great detail, both at the Tevatron and the LHC.  
At the LHC, \emph{top}-quarks are mainly produced in pairs of top-antitop ($t\bar{t}$) with a cross-section of around 800 $pb$ at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV.
The large amount of \emph{top}-quarks produced at the LHC opened a new era of precision measurements, where systematic uncertainties dominate the final results. Systematic uncertainties arise in all physics analyses where there exist uncertainties in the predictions of any of the Monte Carlo simulation steps. Uncertainties arising from the detector simulation are normally referred to as \emph{experimental}, whereas any uncertainty that arises in any of the other steps is usually classified as \emph{theoretical}. In the measurements reviewed in this work the main contribution to the systematic uncertainty is given by the theoretical component.
The big impact of the theoretical uncertainties prompted the reaction of both the theoretical and experimental comunities which in the last years released higher older calculations and made use of data to tune the simulations.
Moreover, different techniques for the estimation of theoretical uncertainties have been developed. In this work, a set of precise \emph{top}-quark measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments is presented, where the different approaches for the systematic uncertainties estimation are compared and discussed.
Two measurements of the inclusive cross-section of $t\bar{t}$ events which make use of a \emph{Profile Likelihood Fit} are discussed. Here, informations on the impact of systematic uncertainties can be extracted from data, the so-called \emph{profiling}, and different techniques are proposed. Morevover, several examples of differential cross-section measurementes are showed, where the derivation of the Covariance Matrix implies or not the usage of toy experiments. Finally, two examples of unfolding measurements in which systematic uncertainties are profiled are discussed. 

\section{Systematic uncertainties in Profile Likelihood Fits}
%In this section two measurements are discussed where a Profile Likelihood (PL) Fit is used.
A Likelihood Fit is a statistical inference technique where a prediction model of the variables under study is constructed. The probability of the observed data under this prediction model is what it is usually referred to as \emph{Likelihood} \cite{kCranmer}.
A simple example is a counting experiment where the signal strenght $\mu$ of a process is extracted from the distribution of observed data. In this case, the signal (S) and background (B) events are assumed to follow a Poissonian distribution: therefore the Likelihood of the observed data in a given bin \emph{i}, $n_i$, is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(n_i|\mu) = \mathcal{P}(n_i|\mu\cdot S_i+B_i).
\end{equation}
In this case, the signal strenght is the physics parameter of interest (POI) of the model. Eventually, other parameters can be added to a Likelihood Fit to account for any effect that might change the signal and/or background predictions. 
These parameters are usually referred to as \emph{nuisance parameters} (NPs) and account for the effect of systematic uncertainties. When systematic uncertainties are added in the statistical model in the form of NPs $\theta$ they are said to be \emph{profiled}. The underlying idea is that systematic uncertainties on the measurement of a POI come from imperfect knowledge of prediction model. It is a common practice at the LHC experiments to include systematic uncertainties in PL Fits as constrained nuisance parameters, where some a priori knowledge is implied. This a priori knowledge is interpreted as subsidiary measurement and implemented as penalty term $\theta = \theta_0\pm\Delta\theta$, where the common convention is to have $\theta_0 = 0$ and $|\Delta\theta| =1$. The penalty term is in the form of a probability density function: usually it is a Gaussian distribution, however also log-normal, gamma or uniform distributions can be used. 
In the case of a Gaussian constraint, the form of the likelihood becomes 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\mu,\vec{\theta}) = \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{\mathrm{bins}}\mathcal{P}(n_i|\mu\cdot S_i(\vec{\theta})+B_i(\vec{\theta}))\cdot\displaystyle\prod_{t=1}^{\mathrm{syst}}\mathcal{G}(\theta_t^0|\theta_t,\Delta\theta_t)
\end{equation}
and the $\Delta\theta$ is interpreted as a Gaussian standard deviation.
This PL statistical framework is largely used to estimate various \emph{top}-quark properties such as the inclusive cross-section \cite{Aad_2020,CMS_inclusive}, the width \cite{ATLAS:2019onj} and the mass \cite{CMS_inclusive}.

\subsection{Profiling theoretical uncertainties}
It has been mentioned how the penalty term of a NP is interpreted as a subsidiary measurement. In the case of experimental systematic uncertainties the quantity that might be mis-modelled is usually well defined and its parametrisation can be identically applied in the physics measurement. Moreover, the underlying information is often based on a dedicated calibration measurement of data. Examples are the reconstruction and identification efficiencies of the physics objetcs or the trigger efficiency. It is important to mention that, even though most experimental uncertainties are easier to treat in PL fits, their treatment might still deserve some level of caution. It might happen that the subsidiary measurement includes theoretical uncertainty which have a big impact in the POI estimation: their correlation should be carefully investigate.
The scenario is different for theoretical uncertainties: for this category of uncertainties it is often unclear which and how many parameters encode the "true" systematic uncertainty. Moreover, the penalty term of theoretical uncertainties might not result from auxiliary measurements. For example, the uncertainty associated with the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scales and missing-higher order calculations are not statistical. It follows that extra caution must be put in profiling theoretical uncertainties: any over-constrain must be carefully investigated and, where possible, multiple variations of the parametric model should be tested to assest any sensitivity to the a priori assumption.
At the LHC experiments, theoretical uncertainties are usually associate to perturbative (i.e. matrix element, parton shower, matching) or non-perturbative (i.e. hadronisation, underlying events) calculations. They can be defined as two-point systematics where the nominal simulation prediction is compared to the prediction provided by an alternative model. Another way of defining a theoretical uncertainty is by varying the internal parameters of the nominal simulation. The detailed definition of these theoritical uncertainty is behind the scope of this work, however, it worths mentioning that it might be useful in the future to think about a more flexible approach for the definition of these uncertainty. The moethod implied to performe the measurement and the phase-space explored can have a big role in the impact of theoretical uncertainties. 
Finally, it is a good pratice to ensure that the over-constraint of a theoretical uncertainty has not been prompted by spurious statistical effects. 

\subsection{Measurement of inclusive cross-section using PL Fit}
This work will focus on the the measurement of the inclusive $t\bar{t}$ production cross-sections performed in the \emph{lepton+jets} final state by the ATLAS Collaboration \cite{Aad_2020} and in the \emph{dileptonic} final state by the CMS Collaboration \cite{CMS_inclusive}. In both these measurements a PL fit is implied: however, different strategies are used for the estimation of the systematic uncertainties. 
In these analyses the inclusive cross-section is extracted from the data in a fiducial phase-space. The fiducial phase space is defined by the analysis requirements on the objects and the events. The cross-section estimated in the fiducial phace-space is proportional to the inclusive cross-section
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathrm{fid}} = A_{\mathrm{fid}} \cdot \sigma_{\mathrm{incl}}, 
\end{equation}
where the acceptance $A_{\mathrm{fid}}$ is defined as the ratio of $t\bar{t}$ events passing the fiducial region cuts over the total number of $t\bar{t}$ events.
The main difference between the two measurement is in the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties in the inclusive phase-space. 
In \cite{Aad_2020} data events fulfilling the fiducial phase-space cuts are used to perform measurements of the fiducial and inclusive $t\bar{t}$ cross-sections from the PL fit. For the $\sigma_{\mathrm{fid}}$ measurement, all samples of the simulated events used to evaluate the $t\bar{t}$ theoretical uncertainties are scaled to the same fiducial acceptance. 
The fiducial acceptance is evaluated using the nominal $t\bar{t}$ sample reweighted to match the \emph{top}-quark $p_T$ theoretical calculation to be consistent with the treatment of the alternative $t\bar{t}$ samples. The scaled distributions enter the fit to measure $\sigma_{\mathrm{fid}}$ reducing the impact of the theoretical uncertainties. For the $\sigma_{\mathrm{incl}}$ extraction, the \emph{top}-pair modelling uncertainties include the uncertainties corresponding to the extrapolation of each systematic uncertainty component to the full phase space. 
Finally, the $\sigma_{\mathrm{incl}}$ is measured in a dedicated PL fit. This latter result is found to be compatible with the result obtained by extrapolating the $\sigma_{\mathrm{incl}}$ from the fiducial phase-space. Small differences in the central values arises from different assumptions made in evaluation of the theoretical uncertainties of $t\bar{t}$ prediction.

On the other hand, in \cite{CMS_inclusive} the PL fit estimates $\sigma_{\mathrm{fid}}$ and its uncertainty. The total cross section is obtained by extrapolating the measured visible cross-section to the full phase space. The extrapolation uncertainty is determined for each relevant model systematic source fixing all nuisance parameters except the one under study to their post-fit values; the nuisance parameter is then set to values +1 and -1, and the variations of $A_{\mathrm{fid}}$ are recorded. The resulting variations of $\sigma_{\mathrm{incl}}$ with respect to the nominal value, obtained with the post-fit value of the NPs, are taken as the additional extrapolation uncertainties. The individual uncertainties in $\sigma_{\mathrm{incl}}$ from these sources are summed in quadrature to estimate the total systematic uncertainty.
Another difference between \cite{Aad_2020} and \cite{CMS_inclusive} stands in the approach used for the luminosity uncertainty: while the ATLAS measurement includes the luminosity uncertainty as a NP of the PL fit, the CMS measurement externalised this contribution.
In \cite{CMS_inclusive} most $t\bar{t}$ theoretical uncertainties show significant constraints with respect to their prior uncertainty, illustrating the strength of the analysis ansatz. The nuisance parameter for the $p_T$ distribution of the top quarks is pulled by one standard deviation. This is expected since it is known that the observed pT distribution of the top quark is softer than predicted by the simulation. An additional uncertainty is determined from pseudo-experiments to estimate the componenet of the NP constrain attributable to the Monte Carlo statistics: this ensures that the observed NPs constraints are not due to spurious effects.

\section{Unfolding: definition of Covariance Matrix}
Differential cross-sections are perfomed by means of \emph{unfolding} techniques. The main goal of unfolding techniques is to infer the true distribution of an observable from the reconstructed one, which is distorted due to detector effects, limited acceptance and finite resolution. 
Several methods are available to unfold data distributions such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) \cite{H_cker_1996}, the iterative Bayes-inspired regulatised unfolding \cite{DAGOSTINI1995487}, the iterative dynamically stabilised method (IDS) \cite{malaescu2009iterative} and the Fully Bayesian Unfolding \cite{choudalakis2012fully}. The choice of the method depends on the analysis aims and strategy. 
This work will focus on the definition of the \emph{Covariance Matrix}. The Covariance Matrix is implied to quantify the agreement between the measured normalised unfolded distributions and the theoretical predictions, therefore a proper definition of the Covariance Matrix is crucial to test the available models. It is a common practice at the LHC experiments to define a $\chi^2$ as
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = V^T_{N_{b-1}}\cdot\mathrm{Cov}^{-1}_{N_{b-1}}\cdot V_{N_{b-1}}
\end{equation}
where $V_{N_{b-1}}$ is the vector of the differences between the data and the prediction, $\mathrm{Cov}^{-1}_{N_{b-1}}$ is the sub-matrix derived from the full covariance matrix.
The Covariance Matrix is usually expressed as the sum of two matrices: one including the statistical uncertainty, the experimental systematics and the background modelling, and a second one including the signal modelling uncertainties. 
Two examples are reported on how to evaluate the experimental systematics and the background modelling uncertainties components of the Covariance Matrix.
The first example is the measurement of the $t\bar{t}$ differential cross-section in the lepton+jets final state perfomed by the ATLAS experiment and documented in \cite{atlas_diffrential}. Here, toy experiments for both the statistical and systematic uncertainties are performed to evaluate the correlation matrix.
The second example is the measurement of the $t\bar{t}$ normalised multi-differential cross-sections performed by the CMS experiment and documented in \cite{Sirunyan_2020}. In this measurement the difference between the systematic and nominal is takes as standard deviation: the correlation between bins is assested by looking at the systematic shits direction.
It is interesting to notice how these approaches are independent on the number of unfolded variables.
Similarly to what has been discussed for \cite{atlas_diffrential}, the measurement of the differential $t\bar{t}$ cross-section in the dilepton final state reported in \cite{atlas_diff_dilep} uses pseudo-experiments to evaulte the statistical correlation between the unfolded distributions. In this measurement the systematic uncertainties are assumed to be correlated between the different distributions. 
In the measurement of the \emph{top}-quark spin correlation and polarisation performed by the CMS experiment \cite{PhysRevD.100.072002}, different variables are unfolded to measure the spin correlation and polarisation coefficients. The systematic Covariance Matrices are derived by looking to shifts direction and assigning a $\pm100\%$ correlation between bins of different distributions.
A new method for the calculation of the modelling Covariance Matrix is reported in \cite{allhad_atlas}. This method is found to improve the p-value results in some variables. It consists of deriving the signal modelling shifts using the expected relative variations from the associated systematic uncertainty to scale each bin of the Poisson-fluctuated distribution unfolded with nominal corrections.

\section{Combining Unfolding and Profiling}
In the previous section, among the unfolding method, the Fully Bayesian Unfolding has been mentioned. This method allows to perform a measurement of a differential cross-section, where systematic uncertainties are profiled within the unfolding procedure. 
The main idea is to perform a PL fit comparing the data to the prediction, espressed as a function of the migration matrix and the true distribution. This method does not involve an expliciti matrix inverions and the prior choice determines the bias. Finally, it implies an automatic handling of the systematic uncertainties and correlations.
The Fully Bayesian Unfolding has been used in the $t\bar{t}$ differential cross-section in the dileptonic final state performed by the CMS experiment \cite{2020135263}. In this measurement the unfoldinf problem was found to be well-conditioned and therefore no regularisation was needed. 
The result of the measurement show a clear improvement of the uncertainty of the unfolded distribution of the $t\bar{t}$ system ($M(t\bar{t})$). If compared to the previous result \cite{CMS_diff_to_compare}, derived using the same data set but without profilinf the uncertainties, the uncertainty on each bin of the unfolded distribution is found to be smaller.
The Fully Bayesian Unfolding technique was used also in the determination of the $t\bar{t}$ asymmetry production performed by the ATLAS experiment \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-026}. In this measurement the asymmetry is estimated simultaneously from different signal regions, exploiting the ability of PL fit to use the informations of different phase spaces. Morevoer, a significant improvement of the pre-fit and post-fit uncertainty is shown, proving again the strenght brought by the combination of unfolding and profiling. 

\section{Conclusions}
The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have produced high precision \emph{top}-quark measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using collision data from the LHC. The different approaches implied for the estimation of systematic uncertainties in inclusive cross-section measurements have been discussed. Additionally, the methods for the derivation of the Covariance Matrix in the measurement of differential cross-sections have been shown. Finally, the first results from the combination of unfolding and profiling has shown how this method succefully delivers measurements with an improved systematic uncertainty.
