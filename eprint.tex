%"Treatment of systematic uncertainties in precision top-quark measurements (including correlations in differential cross-sections among different distributions)”

%CMS abstract
%Using the large data sample of Run-II LHC, the treatment of systematic uncertainties plays a crucial role in the precision era of the top quark measurements. Uncertainties can be determined in situ, profiled in the fit, externalised and/or determined from pseudo-experiments. A selected set of precise top quark measurements (cross section?, direct top mass?, top width?) from ATLAS and CMS is presented where justifications are provided and discussed for every treatment.

A review of some of the recent \emph{top}-quark precision measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations is presented. The different approaches for the determination of the systematic uncertainties are discussed.

\section{Introduction}
The \emph{top}-quark was observed for the first time in proton-antiproton ($p\bar{p}$) collisions at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 Collaborations 
\cite{Abe_1995,Abachi_1995}. It is the heaviest Standard Model (SM) particle known: its average mass, computed by combining the measurements performed by the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments \cite{atlas2014combination}, is 
\begin{equation}
m_{\mathrm{top}} = 173.34 \pm 0.27(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.71(\mathrm{syst})~\mathrm{GeV}.
\end{equation}
Due to its large mass the \emph{top}-quark has the largest Yukawa coupling and its lifetime is smaller than the hadronisation time. From this latter fact, it derives that the \emph{top}-quark is never confined in bound states (\emph{hadrons}). This peculiarity offers the unique opportunity to study the properties of a ``free" quark.
For these reasons, the \emph{top}-quark is considered to be a good probe to test the SM and beyond and, since the first observation, its properties have been studied in great detail, both at the Tevatron and the LHC.  
At the LHC, \emph{top}-quarks are mainly produced in pairs of top-antitop ($t\bar{t}$) with a cross-section of around 800 $pb$ at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV.
The large amount of \emph{top}-quarks produced at the LHC opened to a new era of precision measurements, where systematic uncertainties dominate the final results. Systematic uncertainties arise in all physics analyses where there exist uncertainties in the predictions of any of the Monte Carlo simulation steps. Uncertainties arising from the detector simulation are normally referred to as \emph{experimental}, whereas any uncertainty that arises in any of the other steps is usually classified as \emph{theoretical}. In the measurements reviewed in this work the main contribution to the systematic uncertainty is given by the theoretical component.
The big impact of the theoretical uncertainties prompted the reaction of both the theoretical and experimental communities which in the last years realised higher older calculations and made use of data to tune the simulations.
Moreover, different techniques for the estimation of theoretical uncertainties have been developed. In this work, a set of precise \emph{top}-quark measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments is presented, where the different approaches for the systematic uncertainties estimation are compared and discussed.
Two measurements of the inclusive cross-section of $t\bar{t}$ events which make use of a \emhp{Profile Likelihood Fit} are discussed. The different treatment of the systematic uncertainties
